Pointers:-

1. When variables are declared, memory location is allocated to each variable. The unary operator(&) 
   gives the address of a variable called as the reference operator.
2. If 'var' is a variable in the program then &var will give its address in the memory.
3. A pointer is variable which holds the address of another variable. The indirection or dereference 
   operator(*) returns the value stored at particular address of a pointer.
4. Pointer variable are declared with same data type as ordinary variables.
5. Declaration of Pointer: datatype *pointer_variable_name;
                      E.g: int *p;
